Eureka ESR is a feature-rich and highly customizable [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme. Using Eureka allows you to customize and deploy your website quickly and easily.

:warning: **Work In Progress**

Tutorials on how to install this theme are still being written. For now, feel free to refer to the [docs for the original Eureka theme](https://www.wangchucheng.com/en/docs/).
